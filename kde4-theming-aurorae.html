      <p>When KDE4 was first released I was shocked at the lack of conguration
options themewise compared to 3.5 and its wealth of options, I had best
note plasma however is a notable exception,  a triumph of customisation
and SVG goodness!</p>
<p>Kwin has needed a decent engine for theming for a while, while its
almost on par in terms of effects with compiz, it has always lacked the
extensive customisation features provided by emerald and its various
engines.</p>
<p>Then there is the default QT theme in KDE4.3 (oxygen). This has many
fans and it is nice to see some technoloigical progress being made in
terms of themeing. Personally im not a fan of the whole oxygen look as
it wastes to many pixels and is mostly plain grey. In my opinion its
only used by alot of people as they lack an alternative.</p>
<p>Currently I’m <a class="reference external" href="http://main.v00d00.net/holiday-sabayon-5-kde-4-3">working
on</a> improving
KDE4.3 experience in Sabayon, we have always shipped the excellent
QtCurve Qt widgetset as a alternative to Oxygen as it very flexable,
fast and can be made to look as you like, it also integrates perfectly
with a GTK theme provided (no winNT style firefox!).</p>
<p>We have, for all the KDE4 releases, shipped with the default Kwin theme
due to the lack of a suitable replacement. Yesterday however, while
browsing through KDE-look.org looking for a new wallpaper for my
machine, I noted the <a class="reference external" href="http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Aurorae+Theme+Engine?content=107158">Aurorae Theme
Engine</a>.
This engine is designed to KDE4.3+ and uses SVGs to decorate the
windows. “Yay!” was my inital thought and I immedietly installed it from
the provided ebuild ( a bumped version with some cleanup is <a class="reference external" href="http://gitweb.sabayonlinux.org/?p=overlay.git;a=commit;h=c3efbeaa1923f902fd8fb2854ac85319b21ce979">on the
sabayon
overlay</a>now).</p>
<p>Work is now in progress on a theme for 5.0 for keep an eye out for
50._beta3 artwork.</p>
